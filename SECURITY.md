## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to explain how users can report a vulnerability.

Please direct reports to [rene.potocnik@sers.si]. We aim to respond to vulnerability reports within 1-2 business days and provide regular updates on the status of reported vulnerabilities. 

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, our security team will evaluate its severity and impact on the project. You can expect an initial response acknowledging the report within 24 hours. 

If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work to develop and release a patch or workaround within 30 days. Once the fix is released, we will notify the reporter and the community about the resolution.

If the vulnerability is deemed to be outside the scope of our project's security policy, we will provide a justification for our decision.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure.
